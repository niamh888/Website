    <h1>Welcome to My About Page</h1>
    <p>My name is Niamh St John Lynch.  I am studying Computer Science at University College Dublin. I am interested in web development and programming. I created this website as part of my studies.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy going to France with my family, going to the beach with our dog "Angel" and learning.  I also love traveling and exploring new places, though this has been limited due to a growing family with lots of school and extracurricular activities.</p>
