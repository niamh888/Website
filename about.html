        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="../images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile photo of Niamh St John Lynch" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; border-radius: 50%; margin: 20px 0;">
    <p>My name is Niamh St John Lynch.  I am studying Computer Science at University College Dublin. I am interested in web development and programming. I created this website as part of my studies.</p>
    <p>I am currently researching the use of AI in the medical device domain and evaluating how AI-enabled Medical Devices can be developed safely and ethically within the existing regulatory framework. It is important to understand the ethical considerations and how it can enhance user experience, health and wellbeing. I am particularly interested in how AI can be used to create personalized content and improve website accessibility.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy going to France with my family, going to the beach with our dog "Angel" and learning.  I also love traveling and exploring new places, though this has been limited due to a growing family with lots of school and extracurricular activities.</p>
